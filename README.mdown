# PiratePad Integration for Drupal 6
* PiratePad.net provides free, public EtherPads for collaborative writing. 
* This module allows you embed them within a custom EtherPad node. 

## Note:
* Depending on your situation or your preference for different etherpad copycat setups available (like primarypad.com http://sync.in or http://typewith.me), this module should be really easy to adapt for your use case. A simple find and replace with "piratepad" => "primarypad" with the functions and file names and changing the urls should get you there. Hopefully!

## Thanks and support go out to the Pirate Party http://www.piratpartiet.se/

## Integrate with OpenAtrium 
* If you are looking to integration etherpads within an OpenAtrium site, see: https://github.com/markwk/atriumed_piratepad
